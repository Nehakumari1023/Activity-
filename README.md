📂 Project Structure
├Machine Learning & NLP Project Portfolio
A collection of three data-driven projects covering Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Statistical Data Analysis, implemented using Python.
Each project demonstrates end-to-end workflows including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and insights.

Part A: IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on classifying IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing.
The goal is to analyze text reviews and build ML models that understand sentiment based on language patterns.

Overview
Sentiment analysis is a key NLP task used in marketing, product reviews, and social media analytics.
This project builds a classification model using TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, and machine learning algorithms to predict sentiment.

Features
Text cleaning & preprocessing
Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization
Feature extraction: BoW, TF-IDF
ML models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM/BERT (optional)
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Visualizations: word clouds, confusion matrix, bar graphs

Tech Stack
Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Part B: News Article Classification
This NLP project classifies news articles into categories such as sports, politics, and technology.

Overview
With large volumes of digital news, automated classification improves content organization and recommendations.
The goal is to preprocess news text and build ML models to categorize articles accurately.

Features
Text cleaning & preprocessing
TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words / Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Classification models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM
Cross-validation
Performance metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall)
Visualization of results

Tech Stack
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn
